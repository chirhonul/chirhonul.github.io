<h1>Using Tails for online privacy</h1>

<p>This document describes how to use the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>
operating system to achieve a degree of privacy online that can be "good enough" in
many cases. The necessary concepts to understand how Tails works and how to use it
will be introduced as needed, with no assumptions beyond general technology skills.</p>

<p>An important note here is that you <strong>should not</strong> use any of the
services you sign up for within a Tails session from a regular OS. For example,
if you signed up for a <a href="#email">private email address</a>, do
<strong>not</strong> log into it from any other computer or OS.</p>

<p>Tails stands for "the amnesic incognito live system", and is an operating system
that's designed to protect your privacy while being fairly easy to use. By default,
no data stored in a session of using the device persists between reboots, and it should
be very hard or impossible to link the same device between sessions.</p>

<p>The installation docs at
<a href="https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html">https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html</a>
guides you through the process of creating a live USB that Tails can be booted from.
You can reboot your device from this USB and do work in general, or do work requiring
higher levels of privacy.</p>

<h2 id="mac">MAC address randomization</h2>

<p>You're likely connected to the Internet via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. The interface that
allows your device to communicate with other network equipment has a value
identifying it called a
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address</a></strong>.
Since this value is a stable, unique identifier for your device, it can be used to
track you.

<p>Wikipedia says:

<blockquote>
According to Edward Snowden, the US National Security Agency has a system that tracks
the movements of everyone in a city by monitoring the MAC addresses of their
electronic devices.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Tails randomizes the MAC address each time it's booted, so your access point only sees
a plausible but short-lived identifier before handing out an IP address so you can
get online. The documentation at <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/MAC_address/">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/MAC_address/</a>
describes the assumptions of the design in great detail.</p>

<h2 id="tor">IP address shielding with the Tor network address</h2>

<p>In order for your device to connect to others on the Internet, e.g in order to
retrieve a web page such as this one, your device needs to have an
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</strong>. In a
typical home setup, this IP address is shared between all devices connected to the
same Wi-Fi hotspot via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a>.
</p>

<p>All network devices on the route between your device and the target device (e.g web server)
can see and record the source and destination IP address. The
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a> uses <strong>onion routing</strong>
to add a privacy-preserving layer on top of TCP/IP. The way this works is that the
connections made from your device to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS#SOCKS5">SOCKS5</a>
proxy on the local device, which then is routed through several nodes on the Tor network
before exiting the network and being sent to the destination server.</p>

<p>The end result is that any attempt to track your traffic across the Internet
is made very difficult or impossible; it's no longer the default that all network
devices can see everything you do.</p>

<h2 id="email">Create a private email address</h2>

<p>The root of many services assumptions about identity is that you have an email address.
Creating a private email address is thus likely going to be a necessary step to get
anything done.</p>

<p>There's a list at
<a href="https://riseup.net/en/security/resources/radical-servers">riseup.net</a>
of email providers. I am using <a href="https://disroot.org">disroot.org</a>, which
is working well so far, and free for a basic account.</p>

<h2 id="git">Manage changes to documents with Git</h2>

<p>More to come here..</p>

<h2 id="persist">Persist data between sessions</h2>

<p>Since a Tails session by design forgets all information when the device is rebooted,
extra steps need to be taken in order to persist data.</p>

<h2 id="gpg">Identification and encryption using GPG</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a> software is
infamously difficult to use, but despite this does allow you to encrypt a message
that can be stored in text format and not decrypted by anyone not in possession of
the private key, as well as signing messages that can be verified by others as coming
from you.</p>
